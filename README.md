# basicbar
This is a small python library. (My first one!)
Its goal is to make algorithms easier to use, by
displaying visual feedback on the progress of the
algorithm! It is quite customisable and uses the
colorama library to add colours. WIP; feel free
to improve my terrible code.
[Publishing to PyPI soon; stay tuned.]
